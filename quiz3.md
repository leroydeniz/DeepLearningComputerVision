# Object Detection

**Question 1**. Two rectangles R1 and R2 have left-up and right-down points A and B, C and D accordingly. Coordinates of points: A (0, 77), B (23, 26), C (15, 51), D (41, 0). Compute IoU of these rectangles in percents. Round answer to the nearest integer in percents.

Resp: 9

**Question 2**. Consider face detector have Miss rate 0.40 for FPPI = 10^-1. We are working with dataset that has 5 faces on each image in average. What Precision and Recall corresponds to this parameters? Enter precision and recall values in percentages with space:

Resp: 97 60

**Question 3**. Consider constructing pyramid for sliding window object detection. Weâ€™d like to use window with size 20x20 pixels and find objects with size from 20 to 50 pixels. Images in pyramid are upscaled with factor 1.1 (i.e. by 10% each time). How many images (including original, not scaled, image) are needed for this pyramid?

Resp: 11

**Question 4**. What data augmentation methods are useful for training HOG+SVM or VJ face detector?

- [x] Flip around vertical axis
- [ ] Flip around horizontal axis
- [ ] Rotate on big angle > 90 degrees
- [x] Rotate on small angle < 20 degrees
- [ ] Random crop
- [x] Small shifts: 1-3 pixels

**Question 5**. We work with video of size 1024x768 pixels and 25 fps. We use sliding window object detector with window size 20x20 pixels and stride 2, 1 image scale (i.e. without pyramid). What should be false positive rate of the detector s.t. detector output false positive less frequently than 1 time per second? Round answer with 1e-07 precision.

Resp: 0.0000002
